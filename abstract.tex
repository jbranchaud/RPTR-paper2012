ROS is quickly becoming one of the more popular frameworks for robotics programming, yet it is still in its infancy. One of the issues this young framework faces is a lack of existing tools for analyzing the systems built in ROS. These systems, though written mostly in C++ and Python, have a number of unique, domain-specific features including the systems' distributed nature and the concept of parameters and the parameter server. These distributed systems and their interaction with the parameters is of particular interest. Though parameters are a powerful feature of ROS systems, they are also prone to misuse when developers do not understand the system-wide interactions that these parameters undergo. Because existing analysis frameworks cannot plug right into the unique ROS environment, we propose a novel approach to runtime monitoring of ROS parameters. Furthermore, we present a tool, RPTR, that we have developed as a proof of concept for our approach and show its effectiveness through a study.
