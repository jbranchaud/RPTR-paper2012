\section{Conclusion}

The RPTR framework provides an enrichment to the ROS parameter server functionality by allowing users to monitor parameter transactions in real time, as well as pose queries about specific parameters after the fact. This type of analysis can be used to verify parameter properties of ROS systems, as well as debug complex parameter-related bugs. In addition, the RPTR tool provides a compact and convenient way to include a library with a target node that is capable of doing in-house publishing and subscribing.
